# Makefile Reference

## Overview

This service uses a standardized Makefile (v2.0) that provides consistent development commands across all Petrosa services. The Makefile automates common tasks like testing, linting, building, and deployment.

## Quick Start

```bash
make help     # Show all available commands
make setup    # Complete environment setup
make pipeline # Run full CI/CD pipeline locally
```

## Commands Reference

### Setup & Installation

#### `make setup`

- After cloning the repository
- When dependencies have changed significantly

**Example:**
```bash
make setup
```

#### `make install`
**Purpose**: Install only production dependencies

**What it does:**
- Installs packages from `requirements.txt`

**When to use:**
- Production environments
- Docker builds
- When you only need runtime dependencies

**Example:**
```bash
make install
```

#### `make install-dev`
**Purpose**: Install development dependencies

**What it does:**
- Installs packages from `requirements-dev.txt`

**When to use:**

```

#### `make clean`
**Purpose**: Clean up cache and temporary files

**What it does:**

**When to use:**
- Before committing code
- To catch type-related bugs early
- As part of code review

**Example:**
```bash
make type-check

**Note**: Initially set to not fail CI, but warnings should be addressed.

#### `make pre-commit`
**Purpose**: Run all pre-commit hooks on all files

**What it does:**

make pre-commit
```

### Testing

#### `make test`
**Purpose**: Run all tests with coverage enforcement

**What it does:**
- Runs pytest on `tests/` directory
- Generates coverage reports (term, HTML, XML)
- Fails if coverage is below 40%

**When to use:**
- Before committing code
- Before creating a PR
- To verify all tests pass

- Generating reports for analysis
- CI/CD coverage tracking

**Example:**
```bash
make coverage
open htmlcov/index.html  # View HTML report
```

### Security

#### `make security`
**Purpose**: Run security scans on code and dependencies

**Purpose**: Run complete CI/CD pipeline locally

**What it does:**
1. Clean up environment
2. Install dev dependencies
3. Format code
4. Run linting
5. Run type checking
6. Run tests with coverage
7. Run security scans
8. Build Docker image
9. Test container

**When to use:**
- Before committing major changes
- Before creating a PR
- To verify everything works end-to-end

**Example:**

## Common Workflows

### Starting Development
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd <repository>
make setup
```

### Before Committing
```bash
make format
make lint
make test
```

### Quick Check
```bash
make format lint test
```

### Full Validation
```bash
make pipeline
```

### Deployment Check
```bash
make build container
make k8s-status
```

## Environment Variables

The Makefile uses the following variables that can be overridden:

```bash
# Override coverage threshold
make test COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=60

# Override Python executable
make setup PYTHON=python3.11

# Override image name
make build IMAGE_NAME=custom-name

# Override namespace
make k8s-status NAMESPACE=my-namespace
```

## Makefile Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PYTHON` | `python3` | Python executable |
| `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` | `40` | Minimum coverage percentage |
| `IMAGE_NAME` | `basename $(CURDIR)` | Docker image name |
| `NAMESPACE` | `petrosa-apps` | Kubernetes namespace |

## Customization

To customize the Makefile for your service:

1. **Coverage threshold**: Adjust `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` variable
2. **Service-specific commands**: Add new targets at the end
3. **Test paths**: Modify test commands if tests are in different location
4. **Build args**: Add Docker build arguments to `build` target

**Example - Add custom target:**
```makefile
migrate: ## Run database migrations
	python manage.py migrate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Issue**: `make: command not found`

**Solution**: Install make
```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install make
```

### Permission Denied

**Issue**: Permission errors when running commands

**Solution**: Ensure you have proper permissions
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh  # Make scripts executable
```

### Docker Errors

**Issue**: Docker commands fail

**Solution**: Ensure Docker is running
```bash
docker info  # Check Docker status
```

### Kubernetes Connection Errors

**Issue**: kubectl cannot connect to cluster

**Solution**: Verify kubeconfig
```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml cluster-info
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run `make help`** to see all available commands
2. **Use `make pipeline`** before creating PRs
3. **Keep Makefile updated** when adding new tools
4. **Don't modify** the standardized Makefile structure
5. **Add service-specific targets** at the end of Makefile
6. **Document new targets** with `## comments`
7. **Use `.PHONY`** for all targets that don't create files
