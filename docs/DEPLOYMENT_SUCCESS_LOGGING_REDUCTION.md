  "namespace": "petrosa-apps",
  "replicas": 1,
  "availableReplicas": 1,
  "readyReplicas": 1,
  "image": "yurisa2/petrosa-socket-client:v1.0.33",
  "revision": "92"
}
```

### Pod Status

## Logging Frequency Verification

### Configuration Confirmed
From pod logs at initialization:
```json
{
  "heartbeat_interval": 60,
  "heartbeat_enabled": true,
  "max_queue_size": 5000,
  "num_processors": 5
}
```

### Message Processing Stats Timing
Verified from live logs - appearing at **60-second intervals**:
```
2025-10-17T00:29:28 - "Message processing stats" (processed: 39625)
2025-10-17T00:30:28 - "Message processing stats" (processed: 48858) [+60s]
2025-10-17T00:31:28 - "Message processing stats" (processed: 60770) [+60s]
```

---

## Changes Summary

### Before
- **Heartbeat logs:** Every 30 seconds (120/hour)
- **Message stats:** Every 100 messages (variable, could be very frequent)
- **Total:** Could be 1+ log per second during high activity

### After
- **Heartbeat logs:** Every 60 seconds (60/hour)
- **Message stats:** Max once per minute (60/hour)
- **Total:** Maximum ~2 logs per minute (120/hour)

### Impact
- ✅ **50%+ reduction** in log volume
- ✅ **Lower storage costs** for Grafana Loki
- ✅ **Better observability performance**
- ✅ **Still comprehensive** - all metrics captured
- ✅ **Configurable** via `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` environment variable

---

## Performance Metrics

### Message Processing (from live logs)
- **Processed messages:** 60,770 in ~7 minutes
- **Throughput:** ~144 messages/second
- **Dropped messages:** 0
- **Queue utilization:** Healthy

### Pod Health
- **Liveness probe:** Passing
- **Readiness probe:** Passing
- **Startup probe:** Passed
- **Resource usage:** Within limits

---

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables control logging frequency:

```bash
# Heartbeat interval (seconds)
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=60  # Default: 60 (changed from 30)

# Enable/disable heartbeat logs
ENABLE_HEARTBEAT=true  # Default: true

# Message stats throttle (hardcoded in client.py)
stats_log_interval=60  # Max once per minute
```

---

## Testing Results

### Local Testing
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Coverage: 43.72% (above 40% threshold)
- ✅ Linting: No issues
- ✅ Security scan: Passed

### Production Verification
- ✅ Deployment successful
- ✅ Pod running with new version
- ✅ Logging frequency verified
- ✅ Message processing functioning correctly
- ✅ No errors or restarts

---

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, rollback can be performed via:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Quick)
Update ConfigMap to override:
```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml \
  set env deployment/petrosa-socket-client \
  HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30 -n petrosa-apps
```

### Option 2: Git Revert (Proper)
```bash
git revert 95419d9
git push origin main
# CI/CD will automatically deploy the reverted version
```

### Option 3: Rollback Deployment
```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml \
  rollout undo deployment/petrosa-socket-client -n petrosa-apps
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Deployment Successful**  
✅ **Logging Frequency Reduced**  
✅ **All Systems Operational**  
✅ **CI/CD Workflow Followed Correctly**  

The logging frequency reduction has been successfully deployed to production using the proper CI/CD workflow. The system is running smoothly with the new configuration, and logging volume has been reduced by at least 50% while maintaining comprehensive observability.

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅
