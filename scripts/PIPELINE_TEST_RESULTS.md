   - ❌ Removed `opentelemetry-instrumentation-runtime-metrics` (unavailable)
   - ✅ All remaining packages verified and tested

2. **Service Name Configuration:**
   - ✅ Added configurable service names via `constants.py`
   - ✅ Environment variable support for customization
   - ✅ Updated all job files to use specific service names

3. **Error Handling:**
   - ✅ Graceful fallbacks when OpenTelemetry unavailable
   - ✅ Disabled problematic instrumentations
   - ✅ Connection retry logic for database operations

## 🏁 **Ready for Production!**

Your OpenTelemetry pipeline is now **100% production-ready**. Here's what you can do:
